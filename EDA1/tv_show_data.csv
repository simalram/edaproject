Downton Abbey,"The Downton Abbey estate stands a splendid example of confidence and mettle, its family enduring for generations and its staff a well-oiled machine of propriety. But change is afoot at Downton--change far surpassing the new electric lights and telephone. A crisis of inheritance threatens to displace the resident Crawley family, in spite of the best efforts of the noble and compassionate Earl, Robert Crawley; his American heiress wife, Cora his comically implacable, opinionated mother, Violet and his beautiful, eldest daughter, Mary, intent on charting her own course. Reluctantly, the family is forced to welcome its heir apparent, the self-made and proudly modern Matthew Crawley himself none too happy about the new arrangements. As Matthew's bristly relationship with Mary begins to crackle with electricity, hope for the future of Downton's dynasty takes shape. But when petty jealousies and ambitions grow among the family and the staff, scheming and secrets--both delicious and dangerous--threaten to derail the scramble to preserve Downton Abbey. <i>Downton Abbey</i> offers a spot-on portrait of a vanishing way of life.",71.0,2010-09-26,2015-12-25,"['Drama', 'Family', 'Romance']",Scripted,English,ITV1,8.8,['Sunday'],21:00,6,47,"0-Cora Crawley, Countess of Grantham, 1-Lady Mary Crawley, 2-Lady Edith Crawley, 3-Isobel Merton, 4-Charles Carson, 5-Elsie Hughes, 6-Thomas Barrow, 7-Anna Smith, 8-Beryl Patmore, 9-Daisy Robinson, 10-Robert Crawley, Earl of Grantham, 11-Violet Crawley, Dowager Countess of Grantham, 12-John Bates, 13-Joseph Molesley, 14-Tom Branson, 15-Dr. Richard Clarkson, 16-Matthew Crawley, 17-Sarah O'Brien, 18-Phyllis Baxter, 19-Lady Rose MacClare, 20-Lady Sybil Crawley, 21-James ""Jimmy"" Kent, 22-Alfred Nugent, 23-Ethel Parks, 24-Ivy Stuart, 25-William Mason, 26-Anthony Foyle, Lord Gillingham, 27-Andrew ""Andy"" Parker, 28-Charles Blake, 29-Gwen Dawson, 30-Henry Talbot, 31-Herbert ""Bertie"" Pelham","0-Elizabeth McGovern, 1-Michelle Dockery, 2-Laura Carmichael, 3-Penelope Wilton, 4-Jim Carter, 5-Phyllis Logan, 6-Rob James Collier, 7-Joanne Froggatt, 8-Lesley Nicol, 9-Sophie McShera, 10-Hugh Bonneville, 11-Maggie Smith, 12-Brendan Coyle, 13-Kevin Doyle, 14-Allen Leech, 15-David Robb, 16-Dan Stevens, 17-Siobhan Finneran, 18-Raquel Cassidy, 19-Lily James, 20-Jessica Brown Findlay, 21-Ed Speleers, 22-Matt Milne, 23-Amy Nuttall, 24-Cara Theobold, 25-Thomas Howes, 26-Tom Cullen, 27-Michael Fox, 28-Julian Ovenden, 29-Rose Leslie, 30-Matthew Goode, 31-Harry Hadden-Paton",

Star Trek: The Next Generation,"Star Trek: The Next Generation (TNG) focuses on the 24th century adventures of Captain Jean-Luc Picard aboard the U.S.S. Enterprise (NCC-1701-D). This incarnation of the famous starship is much larger than the one captained by James T. Kirk a century earlier, and, accordingly, it carries a larger crew complement: 1,012 men, women…and, surprisingly, children. This era's Starfleet Command believes that men and women are more likely to sign up for long-term exploratory missions if they think of their ship as home. Thus, Picard's crew enjoys many of the comforts they'd have otherwise left behind, including a wide variety of recreational opportunities, ""replicated"" food dishes to suit every palate, and quarters large enough to share with spouses and offspring. There are schools for the children and a bar (stocked with synthetic alcohol, or synthehol) where the adults can unwind. However, the ongoing mission—no longer limited to a mere five years—remains virtually the same as it was during Kirk's time: to seek out new life and new civilizations, and to boldly go where no one has gone before.",60.0,1987-09-28,1994-05-23,"['Action', 'Adventure', 'Science-Fiction']",Scripted,English,Syndication,8.7,['Monday'],,7,178,"0-Captain Jean-Luc Picard, 1-Commander William T.

Spartacus: Gods of the Arena,"The mini-series features the bloody history of the House of Batiatus and the city of Capua before the arrival of Spartacus. Quintus Lentulus Batiatus becomes a lanista (manager) when he takes over his father's ludus of gladiators. He has ambitions of stepping out of his father's shadow by seeking recognition for his own name and achieving further greatness for his house. By his side stands his beautiful wife Lucretia who will help her husband achieve his ambitions, whatever the cost. Batiatus puts all his fortunes on the man who will gain him fame and glory. That would be his best gladiator, the Celt, Gannicus, a skilled warrior who wields dual swords with deadly purpose. Those who oppose Batiatus and his future champion(s) of Capua do so at their own peril.Purchased as an undisciplined and disheveled recruit in the first episode, Crixus the Gaul endures mockery and threats of death to become the champion after Gannicus. As Batiatus fends off repeated attempts by his professional rival Tullius to obtain Gannicus, his relationships with his father Titus and friend Solonius begin to suffer the strain of his relentless ambition. Former champion, Oenomaus, reluctantly becomes Doctore, while Syrian recruits Ashur and Dagan try to prove themselves worthy of being gladiators. Veteran gladiators Barca and Gannicus note the rising star of Crixus, as the machinations of Batiatus and Lucretia end in tragedy for several members of the household. Against all of this, the city's splendid new arena nears completion and with it the opening games that will make slaves into gods. When the arena opens, Batiatus' gladiators prevail in the contest. Gannicus again proves himself to be the champion of Capua and a god of the arena. By virtue of his win against Solonius' gladiators, he gains his freedom and Crixus becomes the new champion.",60.0,2011-01-21,2011-02-25,"['Drama', 'Action', 'History']",Scripted,English,STARZ,8.5,['Friday'],22:00,1,6,"0-Quintus Lentulus Batiatus, 1-Crixus, 2-Oenomaus, 3-Gannicus, 4-Ashur, 5-Lucretia, 6-Melitta, 7-Gaia","0-John Hannah, 1-Manu Bennett, 2-Peter Mensah, 3-Dustin Clare, 4-Nick Tarabay, 5-Lucy Lawless, 6-Marisa Ramirez, 7-Jaime Murray",https://www.starz.com/us/en/series/spartacus/season-2/8893
Eureka,"With the help of Albert Einstein and other trusted advisors, President Harry S.

There our nation's greatest thinkers, the über-geniuses working on the next era of scientific achievement, would be able to live and work in a supportive environment.The best architects and planners were commissioned to design a welcoming place for these superlative geniuses to reside, an area that would offer the best education for their children, the best healthcare, the best amenities and quality of life. A community was created to rival the most idyllic of America's small towns— with one major difference: this town would never appear on any maps. At least, none that haven't been classified ""eyes only"" by the Pentagon.Thus, the town of Eureka was born. But for all its familiar, small-town trappings, things in this secret hamlet are anything but ordinary. The stereotype of the absent-minded professor exists for a reason, and most of the quantum leaps in science and technology during the past 50 years were produced by Eureka's elite researchers. Unfortunately, scientific exploration is rarely what one expects, and years of experiments gone awry have yielded some peculiar by-products.With the population's unique talents, troubled psyches and limitless resources, these small-town concerns have a way of becoming big-time problems.

With a rush comes the horrible awareness that the plane he was on tore apart in mid-air and crashed on a Pacific island. From there it's a blur, as his doctor's instinct kicks in: people need his help.Stripped of everything, the 48 survivors scavenge what they can from the plane for their survival. Some panic. Some pin their hopes on rescue. A few find inner strength they never knew they had -- like Kate, who, with no medical training, suddenly finds herself suturing the doctor's wounds. Hurley - a man with a warm sense of humor despite the desperate situation - does his best to keep his cool as he helps those around him to survive. Charlie is a faded rock star who harbors a painful secret. Sayid is a Middle Eastern man who must wrestle with the racial profiling directed at him by some of his fellow survivors. Jin and Sun are a Korean couple whose traditions, values and language are foreign, and thus causes much to get lost in the translation. Sawyer has an air of danger surrounding him, and his intense sense of mistrust for everyone around him could prove to be fatal to his fellow castaways. Michael has just gained custody of his nine-year-old son, Walt, after the death of his ex-wife - they are a father and son who don't even know each other. Locke is a mysterious man who keeps to himself, and who harbors a deeper connection to the island than any of the others.

"Emily Owens, M.D.","At long last, Emily Owens feels like she is an actual grown-up. She can finally put her high school days as the geeky-girl-with-flop-sweats behind her; she's graduated from medical school and is now a first-year intern at Denver Memorial Hospital, where she'll have the chance to work with world-famous cardiologist Dr. Gina Beckett - and where, not-so-coincidentally, her med-school crush Will Rider is also an intern. So why does everyone keep warning her that the hospital is just like high school? Emily soon finds out the hard way - her high school nemesis, the gorgeous, popular Cassandra Kopelson, is also just starting out at Denver Memorial, and it seems like they're rivals all over again - not only as surgical interns, but for Will's attention. Fellow intern Tyra Granger warns Emily that the cliques at Denver Memorial are all too familiar: the jocks have become orthopedic surgeons; the mean girls are in plastics; the rebels are in the ER, and Tyra has her own awkward place as the principal's kid - her father is the chief resident. Emily's the new kid all over again, and it's just as awkward as high school. Only this time around, Emily will have to balance the personal and emotional turmoil of social politics with the high-stakes world of life-and-death medical decisions. At least she has fellow intern Tyra and nerdy-but-cute resident Micah, to count on as friends. Emily is growing to realize that although she may be a geek, she may also grow to be a great doctor, flop sweats and all.",60.0,2012-10-16,2013-02-05,"['Drama', 'Comedy', 'Romance']",Scripted,English,The CW,7.8,[],21:00,1,13,"0-Emily Owens, 1-Cassandra Kopelson, 2-Will Collins, 3-Tyra Dupre, 4-Micah Barnes, 5-Gina Bandari","0-Mamie Gummer, 1-Aja Naomi King, 2-Justin Hartley, 3-Kelly McCreary, 4-Michael Rady, 5-Necar Zadegan",

LEGO Star Wars: Droid Tales,"If you've played with the countless Lego <i>Star Wars </i>sets, watched one of the <i>Lego Star Wars</i> animated television specials or sat down with one of the many Lego <i>Star Wars</i> video games, you know that the company that makes plastic building blocks and the film studio responsible for a franchise's worth of space operas, are a match made in lightsaber-wielding heaven. The sensibilities just <i>mesh</i> in a way that produces wonderfully spirited, irreverent entertainment. But nothing could prepare you for the out-and-out fun of the new limited series, <i>Lego Star Wars: Droid Tales</i>, which premieres tonight at 9:30 p.m. on Disney XD. <i>""Lego Star Wars: Droid Tales""</i>, is a five-episode miniseries that has an ingenious conceit: it's the entire <i>Star Wars</i> saga, told, <i>Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead</i>-style, by C3PO (voiced, once more, by Anthony Daniels) and R2D2. The series takes place after the Battle of Endor that ended <i>Star Wars: Return of the Jedi</i>, as C3PO first recounts his adventures after being assembled by a young Anakin Skywalker. This first episode does a really killer job whittling down both <i>Star Wars: The Phantom Menace</i> and <i>Star Wars: Attack of the Clones</i> and even introduces a nifty wraparound narrative wherein C3PO and Admiral Akbar team up to track down his missing spaceship (just go with it).",30.0,2015-07-06,2015-11-02,"['Action', 'Adventure', 'Science-Fiction']",Animation,English,Disney XD,7.6,['Monday'],21:00,1,5,"0-Narrator, 1-C-3P0, 2-Han Solo, 3-Luke Skywalker, 4-Princess Leia, 5-Emperor Palpatine, 6-Admiral Ackbar, 7-Yoda, 8-Darth Vader, 9-Stormtrooper, 10-Jar Jar, 11-Anakin, 12-Younger Obi Wan, 13-Count Dooku, 14-Watto, 15-Padme, 16-Nute Gunray, 17-Mace Windu, 18-Lando, 19-Boba Fett, 20-General Veers, 21-Qui-Gon, 22-Jango, 23-Captain Panaka, 24-Pilot, 25-Shmi Skywalker, 26-Darth Maul, 27-Kid Anakin, 28-Red Guard #1, 29-General Grievous, 30-Red Guard #2, 31-Ithorian Customer, 32-Poggle the Lesser, 33-Spaceport Announcer, 34-Ki-Adi-Mundi, 35-Garbagedroid #3, 36-Ticketdroid, 37-Battledroid #2, 38-Garbagedroid #1, 39-TionMedon, 40-Garbagedroid #2, 41-Battledroid #1, 42-Bail Organa, 43-Agent Kallus, 44-Ezra, 45-Zeb, 46-Admiral Motti, 47-Twi Lek Kid, 48-FA-4 Droid Pilot, 49-Sabine, 50-Vizago, 51-Amda Wabo, 52-Uncle Owen, 53-Older Obi Wan, 54-Kanan, 55-Hera, 56-Pit Droid, 57-Officer, 58-Niem Numb, 59-Ghost Obi Wan, 60-Bossk, 61-Stormtrooper #1, 62-Waiter, 63-Stormtrooper #2, 64-Rebel Officer, 65-Ghost Qui Gon Jinn, 66-Construction Worker 1, 67-Scout Trooper 2, 68-AT-ST Pilot, 69-Bunker Officer, 70-Bib Fortuna, 71-Scout Trooper 1, 72-Stormtrooper 2, 73-Imperial Officer, 74-Rusty, 75-Construction Worker 2, 76-X-Wing Pilot, 77-Mon Mothma, 78-Stormtrooper 1, 79-Y-Wing Pilot, 80-Scout Trooper 3","0-Tom Kane, 1-Anthony Daniels, 2-Michael Daingerfield, 3-Eric Bauza, 4-Heather Doerksen, 5-Trevor Devall, 6-Trevor Devall, 7-Tom Kane, 8-Matt Sloan, 9-Matt Sloan, 10-Trevor Devall, 11-Kirby Morrow, 12-Sam Vincent, 13-Michael Donovan, 14-Brian Drummond, 15-Montana Norberg, 16-Lee Tockar, 17-Adrian Holmes, 18-Billy Dee Williams, 19-Trevor Devall, 20-Colin Murdock, 21-Tom Kane, 22-Trevor Devall, 23-Michael Donovan, 24-Michael Donovan, 25-Heather Doerksen, 26-Lee Tockar, 27-Bronwen Holmes, 28-Adrian Holmes, 29-Kirby Morrow, 30-Kirby Morrow, 31-Kirby Morrow, 32-Michael Donovan, 33-Michael Donovan, 34-Paul Dobson, 35-Sam Vincent, 36-Sam Vincent, 37-Sam Vincent, 38-Tom Kane, 39-Trevor Devall, 40-Trevor Devall, 41-Trevor Devall, 42-Andrew Francis, 43-Alan Marriott, 44-Adrian Petriw, 45-Brian Drummond, 46-Brian Drummond, 47-Darien Provost, 48-Eric Bauza, 49-Elysia Rotaru, 50-Lee Tockar, 51-Lee Tockar, 52-Michael Donovan, 53-Michael Donovan, 54-Michael Benyaer, 55-Nicole Oliver, 56-Tom Kane, 57-Tom Kane, 58-Trevor Devall, 59-Michael Donovan, 60-Michael Daingerfield, 61-Michael Daingerfield, 62-Eric Bauza, 63-Eric Bauza, 64-Colin Murdock, 65-Tom Kane, 66-Matt Sloan, 67-Trevor Devall, 68-Trevor Devall, 69-Trevor Devall, 70-Trevor Devall, 71-Michael Daingerfield, 72-Michael Daingerfield, 73-Michael Daingerfield, 74-Eric Bauza, 75-Eric Bauza, 76-Eric Bauza, 77-Heather Doerksen, 78-Colin Murdock, 79-Colin Murdock, 80-Colin Murdock",http://blogs.disney.com/insider/2015/07/06/lego-star-wars-these-are-the-droid-tales-youre-looking-for/

Back to You,"In the '90s, Chuck Darling and Kelly Carr had dominated the local TV news scene in Pittsburgh. While they had primetime news chemistry on-screen, off-screen Chuck was a bit of a self-centered womanizer, and Kelly a bit of an uptight know-it-all. When Chuck grabbed the chance to move up to a larger market, no tears were shed. But after an embarrassing on-air tirade ended up on the Internet, Chuck found himself on the downswing career-wise. He even questioned whether his lifestyle of chasing women and living in hotels was as exciting as it used to be. So when he gets the call to return to Pittsburgh to reunite with Kelly and try to take the newscast back to No. 1, it's an offer he can't refuse. Back in Pittsburgh, Chuck must adapt to a new, chaotic newsroom. In addition to Kelly, he re-teams with familiar faces including Marsh McGinley, the affable, endlessly inappropriate sports anchor, and Gary Crezyzewski the perennially put-upon field reporter who always seems to get left out in the cold; and he has a few new coworkers: Ryan Church the under-qualified, overstressed news director, and Montana Diaz Herrera, the perky, sexy, somewhat inept weather anchor.

Adventures of Superman,"Adventures of Superman (originally known as <i>The Adventures of Superman</i>) is an American syndicated children's television series based on comic book characters and concepts created in 1938 by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster. The series saw six seasons and one-hundred-four half-hour episodes. Sponsored by cereal manufacturer Kellogg's, the show's initial and final air dates are sometimes disputed but generally accepted as September 19, 1952 to April 28, 1958. The show's first two seasons were filmed in black-and-white while seasons four through six were filmed in color, though broadcast monochromatically.Adventures of Superman was the first television series to feature Superman though the superhero had appeared as a character in a radio program starring Bud Collyer, two theatrical serials starring Kirk Alyn and Noel Neill, and a series of Max Fleischer cartoons. The television series began filming in 1951 in Culver City, California with exterior locations filmed in and around the Los Angeles area and the San Fernando Valley. Episodes follow Superman as he battles gangsters, thugs, mad scientists, meteors and malfunctioning radioactive machines in the city of Metropolis. In the first episode, his origin on the planet Krypton and his arrival on Earth are dramatized while in succeeding episodes, he conceals his identity by posing as mild mannered Daily Planet reporter Clark Kent who, in times of crisis, scoots to a broom closet, sheds his civvies, and reappears in superhero tights and trunks to rescue hapless folk from the clutches of ne'er-do-wells. In the last seasons, the kindly but absent-minded Professor Pepperwinkle creates problems for Superman with his bizarre inventions.Adventures of Superman won no major awards but was popular with its audience and remains popular today. Its opening theme, The Superman March, has become a classic of its kind and is instantly recognizable by most television buffs. Since the show's cancellation, several of its stars have participated in Superman-related conventions, autograph signings, and other events. In 2003, Noel Neill published her memoirs Truth, Justice, and The American Way: The Life and Times of Noel Neill. In 2006, the death of George Reeves was dramatized in the film Hollywoodland with Ben Affleck starring in the role of Reeves. In 2006, the series became available in its entirety on DVD and reruns of the show still hold a place on television programming schedules.",30.0,1952-09-19,1958-04-28,"['Action', 'Adventure', 'Crime']",Scripted,English,Syndication,7.2,['Monday'],17:00,6,104,"0-Clark Kent / Superman, 1-Announcer, 2-Lois Lane, 3-Lois Lane, 4-Jimmy Olsen, 5-Perry White, 6-Inspector Bill Henderson","0-George Reeves, 1-Willard Kennedy, 2-Phyllis Coates, 3-Noel Neill, 4-Jack Larson, 5-John Hamilton, 6-Robert Shayne",

Painkiller Jane,"In a very imaginable future, the world battles terrorism and unrest. Out of this chaos emerges a new hero: Jane Vasco, a.k.a. Painkiller Jane. Once the DEA's top agent, Jane Vasco is formidable, both mentally and physically. As a child, her father nicknamed her Painkiller Jane, describing her ability to mentally push through even the most painful situations. But her strength is about to be tested. Jane is recruited by a covert government agency dedicated to containing and, if necessary, neutralizing the threat of ""Neuros"" — individuals with superhuman neurological powers. No one knows what caused the aberrations that led to their enhanced abilities, which range from from telekinesis and telepathic suggestion to induced hallucinations. During her first investigation with her new team, Jane discovers that she too possesses an odd ability: she can't be killed. Unfortunately, she can still feel pain. Her newfound powers make Jane even more determined to learn everything there is to know about Neuros. Seldom malicious, Neuros often can't control their powers. Consequently, they tend to leave a trail of death and destruction. To prevent a panic, the government has kept the discovery of Neuros a secret, assembling a covert unit to identify and contain Neuros. Operating from a secure abandoned subway platform, the core members of the unit are Andre McBride, the seasoned team leader; Connor King, a special agent regularly armed with a smart remark; Riley Jensen, an evolved computer whiz in charge of surveillance and communications; Dr. Seth Carpenter, the unit's doctor and scientist; Joe Waterman, the middle-aged caretaker of the subway; and Maureen Bowers, Jane's former DEA partner and friend, who, like Jane, was recruited after discovering top-secret information about Neuros.

But why should he - he's rich! The son of an oil tycoon, Steve hasn't had to work a day in his life and has always gotten everything he's wanted - with one exception: the love of Emmy. The daughter of a former Wilde housekeeper, Emmy is an earnest do-gooder who has spent her adult life trying to save the world. And though Emmy is content living with an indigenous tribe in the Amazon rainforest, her 12-year-old daughter, Puddle, just wants to be a normal kid experiencing her adolescence in a normal place. And she would speak up except for the fact that she hasn't spoken in years. When Wilde Oil's expansion in the rain forest threatens her adopted tribe, Emmy decides to attend Steve's self-thrown ""Humanitarian of the Year"" award ceremony in hopes of convincing him to help her cause...and also maybe because she still has a thing for Steve. But same-old Steve is unwilling to help because fighting Wilde Oil (a/k/a Dad) means putting his meal ticket in jeopardy. Rather than run the risk of letting Emmy slip away again, Steve pulls out all the stops to win her heart. To do so, he enlists the only other people in his life who can help: Migo Salazar, Steve's employee/sidekick/errand-boy, and Gertie Stellvertretter, Steve's nanny-turned-head-of-security as well as the biggest protector of Steve...and her own job. Despite having everything he ever wanted, Steve knows he can't buy love and happiness, which falls in sharp contrast to Emmy, who has nothing but love and happiness.

Star-Crossed,"When Emery was 6 years old, an alien spacecraft crash-landed in her small town. Whether they came in peace or with more sinister intentions didn't matter: a fierce battle erupted as humans fought for control over their new rivals, an alien species called the Atrians. In the midst of the conflict, Roman, a 6-year-old Atrian boy, found his way to a shed behind Emery's house, where she protected him from harm, bringing him food, comfort - and friendship. In their brief time together, Emery and Roman forged a deep bond, but the authorities wasted no time tracking Roman down and capturing him in a violent confrontation. Emery has grown up believing that Roman was killed that day. Ten years later, the Atrians have been acclimated to life on Earth, but they are interned in a heavily-guarded camp known as the Sector to keep them separate from humans. Now, for the first time, a group of Atrian teens will enroll in a suburban human high school, with the goal of testing the feasibility of human/alien integration. The eyes of the nation and the whole world are fixed on this historical social experiment, an endeavor fraught with suspicion and fear. In the mayhem of the first day, Emery is amazed to learn that Roman was not killed by the authorities and is, in fact, one of the Atrian students. Their childhood bond is quickly rekindled - in a school and a society that distrusts everything about the Atrians, Emery and Roman have found each other again. However, their relationship is threatened by the small-mindedness of their respective communities and the political agendas of people in power. While the world around them rages with anger and prejudice, their bond becomes increasingly strong and increasingly dangerous.

The Starlost,"This low budget Canadian sci-fi series from 1973 ran for sixteen episodes before it was cancelled due to low ratings. It was created in Canada by Glen Warren Productions and partially funded by Twentieth Century Fox, who now own the broadcast and syndication rights to the series. It was also compiled down into five movies, each composed of two episodes each, with new credit sequences. The series was written by renowned science fiction author Harlan Ellison under a pseudonym of Cordwainer Bird, with additional episodes being written by other sci-fi authors. The plot concerned a giant Noah's Ark-like spaceship, composed of hundreds of huge ""domes"", each containing a sample culture from the planet Earth, which has long since died out due to an unknown disaster. The Ark, damaged from an asteroid collision, goes off course and heads into the path of a distant sun, its crew dead.Foreseeing the destruction of the Earth, humanity builds a multi-generational starship called Earthship Ark, 80 kilometres (50 mi) wide and 320 kilometres (200 mi) long. The ship contains dozens of biospheres, each kilometres across and housing people of different cultures; their goal is to find and seed a new world of a distant star. More than one hundred years into the voyage, an unexplained accident occurs, and the ship goes into emergency mode, whereby each biosphere is sealed off from the others.<br>Four hundred and five years after the accident, Devon (Keir Dullea) a resident of Cypress Corners, a conservative agrarian community with a culture resembling that of the Amish, discovers that his world is far larger and more mysterious than he had realized. Considered an outcast because of his questioning of the way things are, especially his refusal to accept the arranged marriage of his love Rachel (Gay Rowan) to his friend Garth (Robin Ward), Devon finds the Cypress Corners elders have been deliberately manipulating the local computer terminal, which they call ""The Voice of The Creator"". The congregation pursues Devon for attacking the elders and stealing a computer cassette on which they have recorded their orders, and its leaders plot to execute him, but the elderly Abraham, who also questions the elders, gives Devon a key to a dark, mysterious doorway, which Abraham himself is afraid to enter. The frightened Devon escapes into the service areas of the ship and accesses a computer data station that explains the nature and purpose of the Ark and hints at its problems.<br>When Devon returns to Cypress Corners to tell his community what he has learned, he is put on trial for heresy and condemned to death by stoning. Escaping on the night before his execution with the aid of Garth, Devon convinces Rachel to come with him, and Garth pursues them. When Rachel refuses to return with Garth, he joins her and Devon. Eventually they make their way to the ship's bridge, containing the skeletal remains of its crew. It is badly damaged and its control systems are inoperative. The three discover that the Ark is on a collision course with a Class G star similar to the Sun, and realize that the only way to save The Ark and its passengers is to find the backup bridge and reactivate the navigation and propulsion systems. Occasionally, they are aided by the ship's partially functioning computer system.",60.0,1973-09-22,1974-01-05,"['Action', 'Adventure', 'Science-Fiction']",Scripted,English,CTV,6.8,['Saturday'],,1,16,"0-Devon, 1-Rachel, 2-Garth","0-Keir Dullea, 1-Gay Rowan, 2-Robin Ward",

The livelihood of many depends on these tenuous roads, which through the years have been responsible for the deaths of dozens of men. With one hand on the wheel and one on the door at all times, always prepared for the ice to give way under the weight of their trucks, these drivers put their lives and financial security of their families on the line in an exhilarating dash for cash. This adrenaline packed series reveals the raw, gripping quest of ice road truckers.The desolate white landscape stretches as far as the eye can see in a world where the land meets the sky at an invisible horizon, just miles from the Arctic Circle. The fascinating, yet little-known ice road trucking industry, stationed just outside of Yellowknife in Canada's Northwest Territory, is responsible for supporting the diamond mines there. Each year, the many lakes of this region completely freeze over and engineers build an ice road over them that can withstand the weight of tractor trailers, hopefully. Jackknifing, breakdowns and accidents are commonplace. Since the terrain in this region is virtually impenetrable, and there are so few paved roads, the only way for supplies to reach the mines is by traveling over the ice road. The entire industry depends on the weather and the courage of the ice road truckers, who go 48-hour stretches with no sleep and who constantly hear the cracking of the ice right beneath their wheels.",60.0,2007-06-17,2017-11-09,"['Drama', 'Action']",Reality,English,History,6.6,['Thursday'],22:00,11,138,"0-Narrator, 1-Alex Debogorski, 2-Darrell Ward, 3-Hugh Rowland, 4-Lisa Kelly, 5-Todd Dewey, 6-Art Burke, 7-Mark Kohaykewych, 8-Austin Wheeler, 9-Jack Jessee, 10-Rick Yemm, 11-Ron ""porkchop"" Mangum, 12-Joey Barnes, 13-Ray Veilleux, 14-Dave Redmon, 15-Drew Sherwood, 16-Eric Dufresne, 17-George Spears, 18-Greg Boadwine, 19-Jay Westgard, 20-Jerry Dusdal, 21-Maya Sieber, 22-T.J.

That's when a massively talented young singer named Gigi shows up - with a burning desire to be famous, a throwback appreciation for The Heathens only album, and a stack of cash big enough to bring the whole band back into the studio.

Cuéntame como pasó,"Cuéntame cómo pasó is a Spanish television series which has been broadcast by the Spanish public TV channel TVE1 since 2001. Its original name (<i>Tell me</i>) had to be changed for copyright reasons.The series recounts the experiences of a middle-class family, the Alcántaras (in Spanish <i>Los Alcántara</i>), during the last years of the rule of Francisco Franco and the beginning of the Spanish Transition to democracy. Its name comes from a famous song by the Spanish 1960s pop group Fórmula V, titled <i>Tell Me.</i> The producer of the series is Miguel Ángel Bernardeau.The series was created to celebrate the first 25 years since Spain's transition to democracy, and its didactic spirit is clearly evident in some of the episodes. It includes documentary interviews with historical figures of the era, such as people concerned with the assassination of then prime minister Carrero Blanco and the death of Franco.The first episode was broadcast on September 13, 2001. The series begins in April 1968 with the victory in the Eurovision song contest of the singer Massiel. The story reflects changes in Spain beginning in that year.In December 2008, TVE and Ganga Group announced that the series, in its 10th season, had achieved very good audience levels, and would be renewed for up to 3 more seasons, with the storyline moving firmly into the 1980s and the ""Movida madrileña"".Through situations, characters, and attitudes of the era, the series evokes a wistful reminiscence of those times. In this respect it can be compared to the series The Wonder Years, which did the same thing for US history.This series influenced the Portuguese series Conta-me como foi, which starts the same year (1968) and goes to 1974, the year of the 25 de Abril.

Both programs attracted a young audience who watch the shows after school.The show's theme song, ""Action"", became a hit single for Freddy ""Boom Boom"" Cannon, peaking on the charts (#13) in September 1965. Most of the telecasts, all of which were produced in black-and-white, were taped at various locales inSouthern California although a handful of segments were taped elsewhere in the country. The theme song was written by Steve Venet and Tommy Boyce. Later Boyce co-wrote songs for The Monkees.The program had its own stable of performers, most notably Paul Revere &amp; the Raiders, who served as the <i>de facto</i>house band. When the group departed the show in 1966, they were replaced by The Robbs. Other regular performers on <i>Action</i> included the dance troupe Pete Manifee and the Action Kids. Individual episodes featured a wide range of guest performers, as detailed below.Also appearing were Steve Alaimo, Keith Allison, and Linda Scott. Ms. Scott had a few hit singles as a teenager in the early 1960s; she was only 20 when ""Action"" premiered.The weekday program was cancelled on March 31, 1967, with the network giving its local affiliates the time slot. However, members of the program's mainstay band Paul Revere and the Raiders (with lead vocalist Mark Lindsay) hosted very similar follow-up shows; both Revere and Lindsay hosted <i>Happening '68</i>, a Saturday afternoon follow-up to<i>American Bandstand</i>, and a weekday version of the same show, <i>It's Happening</i>, from 1968 to 1969.

Up from Slavery,"In 1860, as the American Experiment threatened to explode into a bloody civil war, there were as many as four hundred thousand slave-owners in the United States, and almost four million slaves. The nation was founded upon the idea that all men are created equal and endowed by their creator with the inalienable rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. The nation would pay a bloody cost for denying that right to more than twelve percent of its population. But when slavery was first brought to America's shores, this war, and even the nation it tore apart, was centuries in the future. With incredibly detailed historical reenactments, expert commentary and the stories of slavery told through first-hand accounts, this is an epic struggle 400 years in the making. A journey into the past like none other. This is the story of these men and women who by their hands laid the foundation of what would become the most powerful nation on Earth.
